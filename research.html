		The detection and characterization of many exoplanetary systems has revealed
		a great diversity among them. This ‘zoo of exoplanets’ is thought to originate from their different
		  formation and evolutionary pathways. These processes are also thought to be imprinted in
			their current atmospheric composition. Characterizing exoplanet atmospheres may therefore be key
			 in order to fully understand planet formation and evolution models.
			<br><br>
		Major observational challenges are the large star-planet contrast and small
		angular separation. Often this is compared to trying to detect a firefly (the planet)
		buzzing around in a lighthouse (the star). High resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy aims
		to solve these problems by disentangling the telluric/stellar lines from the exoplanet
		spectral lines at high spectral resolution using the exoplanet orbital phase dependent red/blue shift.
		After stellar/telluric lines are removed, we can sum up the signal of all lines by cross-correlating
		with a model template. This technique has successfully detected atomic/molecular species and winds
		in exoplanet atmospheres.

		 <em>Animation: Toy model explaining high resolution spectroscopy. As the planet orbits its host stars
		 its blueshift/redshift change. However, telluric/stellar lines are (quasi-)stationary in this rest frame
	 compared to the much larger planet orbital velocity. After obtaining a spectral time series, one tries
 to remove the vertical stripes (telluric/stellar absorbtion lines) such that only the exoplanetary lines remain.

		 In my current research I use this technique to analyze data observed as part of the
		 Multiple Mirror Telescope Exoplanet Atmosphere Survey (MEASURE) program.
		 This survey includes a diverse set of eleven hot-Jupiters and sub-Saturns.
		 This relatively large set of exoplanets will be used to search for trends in
		 the structure and composition of exoplanet atmospheres.
		 <br><br>
		 In the future, this might lead to new insights in how planets form and evolve.
		 Furthermore, pioneering this technique for the largest exoplanets leads the
		 way for the application on smaller, Earth-sized planets. Eventually, this
		 technique might be used to search for biomarkers in Earth-sized exoplanets.
